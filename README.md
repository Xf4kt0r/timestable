# timestable
A simple script to spit out a times table, written in python and bash.  

## Why
My 5yr old asked me for 20x20 times table which I found on the internet pretty easily.  A few days later, he asked for a 40x40 times table. Enter the time to script this out.  

## What
I first created it in Bash and then decided I wanted a Python version as well.  Currently, the Python version is a bit better as it asks for user input but needs input validation.  Whereas, the Bash version requires the user to change the variables.

## Overall
Just practicing some scripting to make the kid happy.
